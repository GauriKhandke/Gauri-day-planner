# Features : 

1. Current day is displyed at the top of the calender.

2. The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.), user can save events at perticular hour.

3. Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

4. Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in `localStorage`, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

4. Each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, present or future. This changes depending on the time of the day.
